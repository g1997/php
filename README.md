Arrays
If the variable is an array the function prints the array in a format 
which displays the keys as well as values, a similar notation is used for 
objects. If the parameter $isStore is set to TRUE then the print_r() function 
will return a string containing the information which it is supposed to print. 
print_r( $var1 );
